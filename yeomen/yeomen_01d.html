        <p><span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>These allusions to my professional duties are in doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We can't all be sorcerers, you know. <span class="dir">(Ph&oelig;be is annoyed.)</span> Ah! you brought that upon yourself.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be.</span> Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer. He's a man of science and an alchemist.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred.</span> Well, whatever he is, he won't be one for long, for he's to be beheaded to-day for dealings with the devil. His master nearly had him last night, when the fire broke out in the Beauchamp Tower.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be.</span> Oh! how I wish he had escaped in the confusion! But take care; there's still time for a reply to his petition for mercy.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred.</span> Ah! I'm content to chance that. This evening at half-past seven &mdash; ah! <span class="dir">(Gesture of chopping off a head.)</span></p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be.</span> You're a cruel monster to speak so unfeelingly of the death of a young and handsome soldier.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>Young and handsome! How do you know he's young and handsome? </p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Because I've seen him every day for weeks past taking his exercise on the Beauchamp Tower.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred.</span> Curse him!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>There, I believe you're jealous of him, now. Jealous of a man I've never spoken to! Jealous of a poor soul who's to die in an hour!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>I am! I'm jealous of everybody and everything. I'm jealous of the very words I speak to you &mdash; because they reach your ears &mdash; and I mustn't go near 'em!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>How unjust you are! Jealous of the words you speak to me! Why, you know as well as I do that I don't even like them.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred.</span> You used to like 'em.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be.</span> I used to pretend I like them. It was mere politeness to comparative strangers.</p>
        <p class="rubric"> Exit Ph&oelig;be, with spinning wheel.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred.</span> I don't believe you know what jealousy is! I don't believe you know how it eats into a man's heart &mdash; and disorders his digestion &mdash; and turns his interior into boiling lead. Oh, you are a heartless jade to trifle with the delicate organization of the human interior. </p>
