          <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>And I helped that man to escape, and I've kept his 
            secret, and pretended that I was his dearly loving sister, and done 
            everything I could think of to make folk believe I was his loving 
            sister, and this is his gratitude! Before I pretend to be sister to 
            anybody again, I'll turn nun, and be sister to everybody&mdash; one as 
            much as another!</p>
            <p class="rubric"> Enter Wilfred.</p>
            <p><span class="dpart">Wilfred.  I</span>n tears, eh? What a plague art thou grizzling for now?</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Why am I grizzling? Thou hast often wept for jealousy &mdash; 
              well, 'tis for jealousy I weep now. Aye, yellow, bilious, jaundiced 
              jealousy. So make the most of that, Master Wilfred.</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>But I have never given thee cause for jealousy. The 
              Lieutenant's cook-maid and I are but the merest gossips!</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Jealous of thee! Bah! I'm jealous of no craven 
              cock-on-a-hill, who crows about what he'd do an he dared! I am 
              jealous of another and a better man than thou &mdash; set that down, Master 
              Wilfred. And he is to marry Elsie Maynard, the pale little fool &mdash; set 
              that down Master Wilfred &mdash; and my heart is wellnigh broken! There, 
              thou hast it all! Make the most of it!</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>The man thou lovest is to marry Elsie Maynard? Why, that 
              is no other than thy brother, Leonard Meryll!</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be.</span>  <span class="dir">(aside)</span> Oh, mercy! what have I said?</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>Why, what matter of brother is this, thou lying little 
              jade? Speak! Who is this man whom thou hast called brother, and 
              fondled, and coddled, and kissed! &mdash; with my connivance, too! Oh Lord! 
              with my connivance! Ha! should it be this Fairfax! <span class="dir">(Ph&oelig;be  starts.)</span>
              It is! It is this accursed Fairfax! It's Fairfax! Fairfax, who &mdash;</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Whom thou hast just shot through the head, and who lies 
              at the bottom of the river!</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>A &mdash; I &mdash; I may have been mistaken. We are but fallible 
              mortals, the best of us. But I'll make sure &mdash; I'll make sure. <span class="dir">(Going)</span></p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Stay &mdash; one word. I think it cannot be Fairfax &mdash; mind, I say 
              I think &mdash; because thou hast just slain Fairfax. But whether he be 
              Fairfax or no Fairfax, he is to marry Elsie &mdash; and &mdash; and &mdash; as thou hast 
              shot him through the head, and he is dead, be content with that, and 
              I will be thy wife!</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>Is that sure?</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Aye, sure enough, for there's no help for it! Thou art a 
              very brute &mdash; but even brutes must marry, I suppose.</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>My beloved. <span class="dir">(Embraces her.)</span></p>

            <p class="rubric">Enter Leonard Meryll, hastily.</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Leonard. </span>Ph&oelig;be, rejoice, for I bring glad tidings. Colonel 
              Fairfax's reprieve was signed two days since, but it was foully and 
              maliciously kept back by Secretary Poltwhistle, who designed that it 
              should arrive after the Colonel's death. It hath just come to hand, 
              and it is now in the Lieutenant's possession!</p>
            <p><span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Then the Colonel is free? Oh, kiss me, kiss me, my dear! 
              Kiss me, again, and again!              </p>
            <p><span class="dpart">Wilfred.</span>  <span class="dir">(dancing with fury)</span> Ods bobs, death o' my life! Art thou 
              mad? Am I mad? Are we all mad?</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Oh, my dear &mdash; my dear, I'm well-nigh crazed with joy! 
              <span class="dir">(Kissing Leonard. )</span></p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>Come away fro him, thou hussy &mdash; thou jade &mdash; thou kissing, 
              clinging cockatrice! And as for thee, sir, devil take thee, I'll rip 
              thee like a herring for this! I'll skin thee for it! I'll cleave 
              thee to the chine! I'll &mdash; oh! Ph&oelig;be! Ph&oelig;be! Who is this man?</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Peace, fool. He is my brother!</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>Another brother! Are there any more of them? Produce them 
              all at once, and let me know the worst!</p>
            <p><span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>This is the real Leonard, dolt; the other was but his 
              substitute. The real Leonard, I say &mdash; my father's own son.              </p>
            <p><span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>How do I know this? Has he &quot;brother&quot; writ large on his 
              brow? I mistrust thy brothers! Thou art but a false jade!</p>
            <p class="rubric"> Exit Leonard.</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Now, Wilfred, be just. Truly I did deceive thee before &mdash; 
              but it was to save a precious life &mdash; and to save it, not for me, but 
              for another. They are to be wed this very day. Is not this enough 
              for thee? Come &mdash; I am thy Ph&oelig;be &mdash; thy very own &mdash; and we will be wed in 
              a year &mdash; or two &mdash; or three, at the most. Is not that enough for thee?</p>
            <p class="rubric">Enter Sergeant Meryll, excitedly, followed by Dame Carruthers, who 
              listens, unobserved.</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Meryll. </span>Ph&oelig;be, hast thou heard the brave news?</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be.</span>  <span class="dir">(still in Wilfred's arms) </span>Aye, father.</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Meryll. </span>I'm nigh mad with joy! <span class="dir">(seeing Wilfred)</span> Why, what's all 
              this?</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Oh, father, he discovered our secret thorough my folly, 
              and the price of his silence is&mdash;              </p>
            <p><span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>Ph&oelig;be's heart.              </p>

            <p> <span class="dpart">Wilfred. </span>It's the same thing!</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Ph&oelig;be. </span>Is it?</p>
            <p class="rubric">Exeunt Wilfred  and Ph&oelig;be.</p>
            <p><span class="dpart">Meryll. </span><span class="dir">(looking after them)</span> 'Tis pity, but the Colonel had to be 
              saved at any cost, and as thy folly revealed our secret, thy folly 
              must e'en suffer for it! <span class="dir">(Dame Carruthers comes down.) </span>Dame 
              Carruthers!</p>
            <p> <span class="dpart">Dame Carruthers. </span>So this is a plot to shield this arch-fiend, and I have 
              detected it. A word from me, and three heads besides his would roll 
              from their shoulders!              </p>
            <p><span class="dpart">Meryll. </span>Nay, Colonel Fairfax is reprieved. <span class="dir">(aside)</span> Yet, if my 
              complicity in his escape were known! Plague on the old meddler! 
              There's nothing for it &mdash; <span class="dir">(aloud)</span> &mdash; Hush, pretty one! Such bloodthirsty 
              words ill become those cherry lips! <span class="dir">(aside)</span> Ugh!              </p>

            <p> <span class="dpart">Meryll. </span>Why, look ye, chuck &mdash; for many a month I've &mdash; I've thought 
              to myself &mdash; &quot;There's snug love saving up in that middle-aged bosom 
              for some one, and why not for thee &mdash; that's me &mdash; so take heart and 
              tell her &mdash; that's thee &mdash; that thou &mdash; that's me &mdash; lovest her &mdash; thee &mdash; and &mdash; 
              and &mdash; well, I'm a miserable old man, and I've done it &mdash; and that's 
              me!&quot; But not a word about Fairfax! The price of thy silence is&mdash;              </p>
            <p><span class="dpart">Dame Carruthers. </span>Meryll's heart?                </p>
