    <div class="btext">
        <p align="left" class="rubric">Enter Dr. Daly.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart"><strong>Dr. Daly. </strong></span><span class="dir">(musing)</span> It is singular &ndash; it is very singular. It has overthrown all my calculations. It is distinctly opposed to the doctrine of averages. I cannot understand it.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Aline. </span>Dear Dr. Daly, what has puzzled you?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Dr. Daly. </span> My dear, this village has not hitherto been addicted to marrying and giving in marriage. Hitherto the youths of this village have not been enterprising, and the maidens have been distinctly coy. Judge then of my surprise when I tell you that the whole village came to me in a body just now, and implored me to join them in matrimony with as little delay as possible. Even your excellent father has hinted to me that before very long it is not unlikely that he may also change his condition.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Aline.</span> Oh, Alexis &ndash; do you hear that? Are you not delighted?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Alexis. </span> Yes, I confess that a union between your mother and my father would be a happy circumstance indeed. <span class="dir">(Crossing to Dr. Daly)</span> My dear sir &ndash; the news that you bring us is very gratifying.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Dr. Daly. </span> Yes &ndash; still, in my eyes, it has its melancholy side. This universal marrying recalls the happy days &ndash; now, alas, gone forever &ndash; when I myself might have &ndash; but tush! I am puling. I am too old to marry &ndash; and yet, within the last half-hour, I have greatly yearned for companionship. I never remarked it before, but the young maidens of this village are very comely. So likewise are the middle-aged. Also the elderly. All are comely &ndash; and <span class="dir">(with a deep sigh)</span> all are engaged!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Aline.</span> Here comes your father.</p>
        <p align="left" class="rubric">Enter Sir Marmaduke with Mrs. Partlet , arm-in-arm.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Aline and Alexis.</span> <span class="dir">(aside)</span> Mrs. Partlet!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Sir Marmaduke. </span> Dr. Daly, give me joy. Alexis, my dear boy, you will, I am sure, be pleased to hear that my declining days are not unlikely to be solaced by the companionship of this good, virtuous, and amiable woman.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Alexis. </span><span class="dir">(rather taken aback)</span> My dear father, this is not altogether what I expected. I am certainly taken somewhat by surprise. Still it can hardly be necessary to assure you that any wife of yours is a mother of mine. <span class="dir">(Aside to Aline.)</span> It is not quite what I could have wished.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Mrs. Partlet. </span><span class="dir">(crossing to Alexis)</span> Oh, sir, I entreat your forgiveness. I am aware that socially I am not heverythink that could be desired, nor am I blessed with an abundance of worldly goods, but I can at least confer on your estimable father the great and priceless dowry of a true, tender, and lovin' 'art!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Alexis.</span> <span class="dir">(coldly).</span> I do not question it. After all, a faithful love is the true source of every earthly joy.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Sir Marmaduke. </span> I knew that my boy would not blame his poor father for acting on the impulse of a heart that has never yet misled him. Zorah is not perhaps what the world calls beautiful &ndash;</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Dr. Daly. </span> Still she is comely &ndash; distinctly comely. <span class="dir">(Sighs)</span></p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Aline.</span> Zorah is very good, and very clean, and honest, and quite, quite sober in her habits: and that is worth far more than beauty, dear Sir Marmaduke.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Dr. Daly. </span> Yes; beauty will fade and perish, but personal cleanliness is practically undying, for it can be renewed whenever it discovers symptoms of decay. My dear Sir Marmaduke, I heartily congratulate you. <span class="dir">(Sighs)</span></p>
