    <hr align="center" width="95%">      <div class="btext">
        <p><span class="dpart">Julia.</span> Well, a nice mess you&rsquo;ve got us into! There&rsquo;s an end of our precious plot! All up &ndash; pop &ndash; fizzle &ndash; bang &ndash; done for!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ludwig.</span> Yes, but &ndash; ha! ha! &ndash; fancy my choosing the Grand Duke&rsquo;s private detective, of all men, to make a confidant of! When you come to think of it, it&rsquo;s really devilish funny!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ernest.</span><span class="dir">(angrily)</span> When you come to think of it, it&rsquo;s extremely injudicious to admit into a conspiracy every pudding-headed baboon who presents himself!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ludwig.</span> Yes &ndash; I should never do that. If I were chairman of this gang, I should hesitate to enrol <em>any</em> baboon who couldn&rsquo;t produce satisfactory credentials from his last Zoological Gardens. </p>
        <p><span class="dpart"> Lisa. </span> Ludwig is far from being a baboon. Poor boy, he could not help giving us away &ndash; it&rsquo;s his trusting nature &ndash; he was deceived.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart"> Julia. </span><span class="dir">(furiously)</span> His trusting nature! <span class="dir">(To Ludwig.)</span> Oh, I should like to talk to you in my own language for five minutes &ndash; only five minutes! I know some good, strong, energetic English remarks that would shrivel your trusting nature into raisins &ndash; only you wouldn&rsquo;t understand them!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ludwig.</span> Here we perceive one of the disadvantages of a neglected education!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ernest. </span><span class="dir">(to Julia)</span> And I suppose you&rsquo;ll never be my Grand Duchess now!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Julia. </span>Grand Duchess? My good friend, if you don&rsquo;t produce the piece how can I play the part?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ernest.</span> True. <span class="dir">(To Ludwig.)</span> You see what you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ludwig.</span> But, my dear sir, you don&rsquo;t seem to understand that the man ate three sausage-rolls. Keep that fact steadily before you. Three large sausage-rolls.</p>
        <p><strong> <span class="dpart">Julia. </span></strong> Bah! &ndash; Lots of people eat sausage-rolls who are not conspirators.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ludwig.</span> Then they shouldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s bad form. It&rsquo;s not the game. When one of the Human Family proposes to eat a sausage-roll, it is his duty to ask himself, &ldquo;Am I a conspirator?&rdquo; And if, on examination, he finds that he is <em>not</em> a conspirator, he is bound in honour to select some other form of refreshment. </p>
        <p><strong> </strong><span class="dpart">Lisa. </span> Of course he is. One should always play the game. <span class="dir">(To Notary,who has been smiling placidly through this.<em>)</em></span> What are you grinning at, you greedy old man?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Notary. </span>Nothing &ndash; don&rsquo;t mind me. It is always amusing to the legal mind to see a parcel of laymen bothering themselves about a matter which to a trained lawyer presents no difficulty whatever.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">All. </span>No difficulty!</p>
        <p><strong> </strong><span class="dpart">Notary. </span>None whatever! The way out of it is quite simple.</p>
        <p><strong> </strong><span class="dpart">All. </span>Simple?</p>
        <p><strong> </strong><span class="dpart">Notary. </span>Certainly! Now attend. In the first place, you two men fight a Statutory Duel.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ernest.</span> A Statutory Duel?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Julia. </span>A Stat-tat-tatutory Duel! Ach! what a crack-jaw language this German is!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Ludwig.</span> Never heard of such a thing.</p>
        <p><strong> </strong><span class="dpart">Notary. </span>It is true that the practice has fallen into abeyance through disuse. But all the laws of Pfennig Halbpfennig run for a hundred years, when they die a natural death, unless, in the meantime, they have been revived for another century. The Act that institutes the Statutory Duel was passed a hundred years ago, and as it has never been revived, it expires tomorrow. So you&rsquo;re just in time.</p>
        <p><strong> </strong><span class="dpart">Julia. </span> But what is the use of talking to us about Statutory Duels when we none of us know what a Statutory Duel is?</p>
        <p><strong> </strong><span class="dpart">Notary. </span> Don&rsquo;t you? Then I&rsquo;ll explain.</p>
