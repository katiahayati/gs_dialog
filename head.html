                Welcome to the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, which is devoted to the operas and other works of &nbsp;W. S. Gilbert and Arthur&nbsp;Sullivan. We also have some pages relating to other light operas of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. The Archive, which was established in September 1993, includes a variety of G&amp;S related items, including clip art, librettos, plot summaries, pictures of the original G&amp;S stars, song scores, midi and mpeg audio files, and newsletter articles. New items are being added regularly.</P>
              <p> This is the &quot;home&quot; site for all Gilbert and Sullivan related activities on the Internet. Links from the Archive lead to many other G&amp;S sites, and to other opera and arts related Internet sites. Please let us know if there are any other sites you think we should link to.</p>
              <P> All questions about Gilbert and Sullivan and their operas should be directed to David Stone at <a href="mailto:dstone4@cox.net" CLASS = "off"  onMouseOver = "this.className ='on';"  onMouseOut = "this.className = 'off';">dstone4@cox.net</a>.
              <p>If you have something which you feel would be appropriate to add to the Archive, send a note to Paul Howarth at <A HREF="mailto:gandsarchive@yahoo.co.uk" CLASS = "off"  onMouseOver = "this.className ='on';"  onMouseOut = "this.className = 'off';">gandsarchive@yahoo.co.uk</A> to make arrangements for your contribution.
