        The old, old tale. How rapturously these maidens love 
        me, and how hopelessly! Oh, Patience, Patience, with the love of thee 
        in my heart, what have I for these poor mad maidens but an unvalued pity?
        Alas, they will die of hopeless love for me, as I shall die of
        hopeless love for thee!</p>

      <p><span class="dpart">Angela.</span> One of your own poems.</p>
      <p><span class="dpart">Grosvenor.</span> One of my own poems? Better not, 
        my child. <em>They</em> will not cure thee of thy love.</p>
      <p><span class="dpart">Ella.</span> Mr. Bunthorne used to read us a poem 
        of his own every day.</p>

        extremely well.</p>

        I should take upon myself to withhold my gifts from you? What am I but 
        a trustee? Here is a decalet &#8212; a pure and simple thing, a very daisy 
        &#8212; a babe might understand it. To appreciate it, it is not necessary to think of anything at all.</p>

      He punched his poor little sisters' heads,<br>
      And cayenne-peppered their four-post beds;<br>
      He plastered their hair with cobbler's wax,<br>
      And dropped hot halfpennies down their backs.<br>

        it was terrible!</p>
      <p><span class="dpart">Ella.</span> Oh, sir, you are indeed a true poet, 
        for you touch our hearts, and they go out to you!</p>
      <p><span class="dpart">Grosvenor.</span> <span class="dir">(aside)</span> 
        This is simply cloying. <span class="dir">(aloud)</span> Ladies, I am 
        sorry to appear ungallant, but this is Saturday, and you have 
        been following me about ever since Monday. I should like the 
        usual half-holiday. I shall take it as a personal favour if you
        will kindly allow me to close early to-day.</p>

      <p><span class="dpart">Grosvenor.</span> Poor, poor girls! It is best to 
        speak plainly. I know that I am loved by you, but I never can love you in return, for 
        my heart is fixed elsewhere! Remember the fable of the Magnet 
        and the Churn.</p>
      <p><span class="dpart">Angela.</span> <span class="dir">(wildly)</span> 
        But we don't know the fable of the Magnet and the Churn!</p>
