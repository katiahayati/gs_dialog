    <div class="btext">
        <p class="rubric">At the end of his song, Patience enters. He sees her.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bunthorne.</span> Ah! Patience, come hither.  I 
          am pleased with thee. The bitter-hearted one, who finds all else 
        hollow, is pleased with thee. For you are not hollow. <em>Are</em> you?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> No, thanks, I have dined; but &#8212; I beg your pardon &mdash; I 
        interrupt you. </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bunthorne.</span> Life is made up of interruptions. The tortured soul, 
          yearning for solitude, writhes under them. Oh, but my heart is 
          a-weary! Oh, I am a cursed thing! 
        Don't go.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> Really, I'm very sorry.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bunthorne.</span> Tell me, girl, do you ever yearn?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience. </span><span class="dir">(misunderstanding him)</span>  I earn my living.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bunthorne.</span><span class="dir"> (impatiently)</span> No,
          no! Do you know what it is to be heart- hungry? Do you know what it
          is to yearn for the Indefinable, and  yet to be brought face to face,
          daily, with the Multiplication  Table? Do you know what
          it is to seek oceans and to find puddles? &#8212; to long for whirlwinds
          and yet have to do the best you can with the bellows? That's my case.
          Oh, I am a cursed thing! Don't go.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> If you please, I don't understand you &mdash; you frighten 
        me!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bunthorne.</span> Don't be frightened &mdash; it's only poetry.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> Well, if that's poetry, I don't like poetry.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bunthorne.</span> <span class="dir">(eagerly)</span> Don't you? <span class="dir">(aside)</span> Can I trust her? <span class="dir">(aloud)</span> 
          Patience, you don't like poetry &mdash; well, between you and me, I 
          don't like poetry. It's hollow, unsubstantial &mdash; unsatisfactory. 
          What's the use of yearning for Elysian Fields when you know you 
          can't get 'em, and would only let `em out on building leases if 
        you had `em?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> Sir, I &mdash;</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bunthorne.</span> Patience, I have long loved you. Let me tell you a secret. 
          I am not as bilious as I look. If you like, I will cut my hair. 
          There is more innocent fun within me than a casual spectator 
          would imagine. You have never seen me frolicsome. Be a good<br>
          girl &mdash; a very good girl &mdash; and one day you shall. If you are 
        fond of touch-and-go jocularity &mdash; this is the shop for it.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> Sir, I will speak plainly. In the matter of love I am 
          untaught. I have never loved but my great-aunt. But I am quite 
        certain that, under any circumstances, I couldn't possibly love<em> you</em>.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bunthorne.</span> Oh, you think not?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> I'm quite sure of it. Quite sure. Quite.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bunthorne.</span> Very good. Life is henceforth a blank. I don't care what 
          becomes of me. I have only to ask that you will not abuse my 
          confidence; though <em>you</em> despise me, I am extremely popular with 
        the other young ladies.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> I only ask that you will leave me and never renew the 
        subject.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bunthorne.</span> Certainly. Broken-hearted and desolate, I go. (Recites.)</p>
        <p align="center"> &quot;Oh, to be wafted away,<br>
      From this black Aceldama of sorrow,<br>
      Where the dust of an earthy to-day<br>
      Is the earth of a dusty to-morrow!&quot;</p>
        <p> It is a little thing of my own. I call it &quot;Heart Foam&quot;. I 
        shall not publish it. Farewell! Patience, Patience, farewell!</p>
        <p class="rubric"> Exit Bunthorne.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> What on earth does it all mean? Why does he love me? 
          Why does he expect me to love him?  He's not a 
        relation! It frightens me!</p>
        <p class="rubric">Enter Angela.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Angela.</span> Why, Patience, what is the matter?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> Lady Angela, tell me two things. Firstly, what on 
          earth is this love that upsets everybody; and, secondly, how is 
        it to be distinguished from insanity?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Angela.</span> Poor blind child! Oh, forgive her, Eros! Why, love is 
          of all passions the most essential! It is the embodiment of 
          purity, the abstraction of refinement! It is the one unselfish 
        emotion in this whirlpool of grasping greed!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> Oh, dear, oh! <span class="dir">(Beginning to cry.)</span></p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Angela.</span> Why are you crying?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience. </span>To think that I have lived all these years without 
          having experienced this ennobling and unselfish passion! Why, 
        what a wicked girl I must be! For it is unselfish, isn't it?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Angela. </span>Absolutely! Love that is tainted with selfishness is no 
          love. Oh, try, try, try to love! It really isn't difficult if 
        you give your whole mind to it.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> I'll set about it at once. I won't go to bed until I'm 
        head over ears in love with somebody.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Angela.</span> Noble girl! But is it possible that you have never loved 
        anybody?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> Yes, one.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Angela.</span> Ah! Whom?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience.</span> My great-aunt &#8212;</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Angela.</span> Great-aunts don't count.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Patience. </span>Then there's nobody. At least &#8212; no, nobody. Not 
          since I was a baby. But that doesn't count, I suppose.<br>
          <br>
          <span class="dpart">Angela.</span> I don't know. Tell me about it.</p>
