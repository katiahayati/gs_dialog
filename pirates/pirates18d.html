        <p><span class="dpart"> Frederic. </span> Upon my word, this is most curious &ndash; most absurdly whimsical. Five-and-a-quarter! No one would think it to look at me!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ruth. </span>You are glad now, I'll be bound, that you spared us. You would never have forgiven yourself when you discovered that you had killed two of your comrades.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic. </span> My comrades?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">King.</span> <span class="dir">(rises)</span> I'm afraid you don't appreciate the delicacy of your position: You were apprenticed to us &ndash;</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span> Until I reached my twenty-first year.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">King.</span> No, until you reached your twenty-first birthday <span class="dir">(producing document)</span>, and, going by birthdays, you are as yet only five-and-a-quarter.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span>You don't mean to say you are going to hold me to that?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">King.</span> No, we merely remind you of the fact, and leave the rest to your sense of duty.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ruth. </span>Your sense of duty!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span> <span class="dir">(wildly)</span> Don't put it on that footing! As I was merciful to you just now, be merciful to me! I implore you not to insist on the letter of your bond just as the cup of happiness is at my lips!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ruth. </span> We insist on nothing; we content ourselves with pointing out to you your duty.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">King.</span> Your duty!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span> <span class="dir">(after a pause)</span> Well, you have appealed to my sense of duty, and my duty is only too clear. I abhor your infamous calling; I shudder at the thought that I have ever been mixed up with it; but duty is before all &ndash; at any price I will do my duty.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">King.</span> Bravely spoken! Come, you are one of us once more.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span> Lead on, I follow. <span class="dir">(suddenly)</span> Oh, horror!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart"> Ruth &amp; King. </span> What is the matter?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span> Ought I to tell you? No, no, I cannot do it; and yet, as one of your band &ndash;</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">King.</span> Speak out, I charge you by that sense of conscientiousness to which we have never yet appealed in vain.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span> General Stanley, the father of my Mabel &ndash;</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ruth &amp; King. </span> Yes, yes!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span> He escaped from you on the plea that he was an orphan?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">King.</span> He did.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span> It breaks my heart to betray the honoured father of the girl I adore, but as your apprentice I have no alternative. It is my duty to tell you that General Stanley is no orphan!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Ruth &amp; King. </span> What!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span> More than that, he never was one!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">King.</span> Am I to understand that, to save his contemptible life, he dared to practise on our credulous simplicity? <span class="dir">(FREDERIC nods as he weeps.)</span> Our revenge shall be swift and terrible. We will go and collect our band and attack Tremorden Castle this very night.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Frederic.</span>But stay &ndash;</p>
       <span class="dpart">King.</span> Not a word! He is doomed! </div>
