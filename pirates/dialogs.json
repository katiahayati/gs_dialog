They still are, though years have rolled over their heads. But this afternoon my obligation ceases. Individually, I love you all with affection unspeakable; but, collectively, I look upon you with a disgust that amounts to absolute detestation.

Every one we capture says heâs an orphan. The last three ships we took proved to be manned entirely by orphans, and so we had to let them go.
