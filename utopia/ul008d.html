      <div class="btext"> <p class="rubric">Enter, at back, Scaphio and Phantis, who watch
Zara as she goes off. Scaphio is seated, shaking violently, and
obviously under the influence of some strong emotion.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Phantis: </span>There &#8212; tell me, Scaphio, is she not beautiful? Can you
  wonder that I love her so passionately?</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio: </span>No. She is extraordinarily &#8212; miraculously lovely! Good
  heavens, what a singularly beautiful girl!</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Phantis: </span>I knew you would say so!</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio: </span>What exquisite charm of manner! What surprising delicacy of
  gesture! Why, she's a goddess! a very goddess!</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Phantis: </span><span class="dir">(rather taken aback)</span> Yes &#8212; she's &#8212; she's an attractive girl.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio: </span>Attractive? Why, you must be blind! &#8212; She's
  entrancing &#8212; enthralling &#8212; intoxicating! <span class="dir">(aside)</span> God bless
  my heart, what's the matter with me?</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Phantis: </span><span class="dir">(alarmed)</span> Yes. You &#8212; you promised to help me to get her
  father's consent, you know.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio: </span>Promised! Yes, but the convulsion has come, my good boy! 
  It is she &#8212; my ideal! Why, what's this? <span class="dir">(staggering)</span>  Phantis! Stop me &#8212; I'm going mad &#8212; mad with the love of her!</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Phantis: </span>Scaphio, compose yourself, I beg. The girl is perfectly
  opaque! Besides, remember &#8212; each of us is helpless without
  the other. You can't succeed without my consent, you know.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio: </span>And you dare to threaten? Oh, ungrateful! When you came to
  me, palsied with love for this girl, and implored my assistance, did I not unhesitatingly promise it? And this is the
  return you make? Out of my sight, ingrate! <span class="dir">(aside)</span> Dear!
  dear! what is the matter with me? </p>
<p class="rubric">Enter Captain Fitzbattleaxe
    and Zara.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Zara: </span>Dear me. I'm afraid we are interrupting a <em>t&ecirc;te-&aacute;-t&ecirc;te</em>.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio: </span><span class="dir">(breathlessly) </span>No, no. You come very appropriately. To be
  brief, we &#8212; we love you &#8212; this man and I &#8212; madly &#8212; passionately!</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Zara: </span>Sir!</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio: </span>And we don't know how we are to settle which of us is to
  marry you.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Fitzbattleaxe: </span>Zara, this is very awkward.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio: </span><span class="dir">(very much overcome)</span> I &#8212; I am paralyzed by the singular
  radiance of your extraordinary loveliness. I know I am
  incoherent. I never was like this before &#8212; it shall not
  occur again. I &#8212; shall be fluent, presently.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Zara: </span><span class="dir">(aside)</span> Oh, dear, Captain Fitzbattleaxe, what is to be
  done?</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Fitzbattleaxe: </span><span class="dir">(aside)</span> Leave it to me &#8212; I'll manage it. <span class="dir">(aloud)</span> It's a
  common situation. Why not settle it in the English fashion?</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio &amp; Phantis:</span>The English fashion? What is that?</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Fitzbattleaxe: </span>It's very simple. In England, when two gentlemen are in
  love with the same lady, and until it is settled which
  gentleman is to blow out the brains of the other, it is
  provided, by the Rival Admirers' Clauses Consolidation Act,
  that the lady shall be entrusted to an officer of Household
  Cavalry as stakeholder, who is bound to hand her over to the
  survivor (on the Tontine principle) in a good condition of
  substantial and decorative repair.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio: </span>Reasonable wear and tear and damages by fire excepted?</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Fitzbattleaxe: </span>Exactly.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Phantis: </span>Well, that seems very reasonable. <span class="dir">(to Scaphio)</span> What do you
  say &#8212; Shall we entrust her to this officer of Household
  Cavalry? It will give us time.</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Scaphio: </span><span class="dir">(trembling violently)</span> I &#8212; I am not at present in a condition
  to think it out coolly &#8212; but if he is an officer of Household
  Cavalry, and if the Princess consents &#8212;</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Zara: </span>Alas, dear sirs, I have no alternative &#8212; under the Rival
  Admirers' Clauses Consolidation Act!</p>
<p><span class="dpart">Fitzbattleaxe: </span>Good &#8212; then that's settled.</p>
