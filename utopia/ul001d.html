        <p><span class="dpart">Calynx: </span>Good news! Great news! His Majesty's eldest daughter,
          Princess Zara, who left our shores five years since to go to
          England--the greatest, the most powerful, the wisest country
          in the world &#8212; has taken a high degree at Girton, and is on
          her way home again, having achieved a complete mastery over
          all the elements that have tended to raise that glorious
          country to her present pre-eminent position among civilized
          nations! </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Salata: </span>Then in a few months Utopia may hope to be completely Anglicized?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Calynx: </span>Absolutely and without a doubt.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Melene: </span><span class="dir">(lazily)</span> We are very well as we are. Life without a
  care &#8212; every want supplied by a kind and fatherly monarch,
  who, despot though he be, has no other thought than to make
  his people happy &#8212; what have we to gain by the great change
  that is in store for us?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Salata: </span>What have we to gain? English institutions, English tastes,
  and oh, English fashions!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Calynx: </span>England has made herself what she is because, in that fa-
  vored land, every one has to think for himself. Here we
  have no need to think, because our monarch anticipates all
  our wants, and our political opinions are formed for us by
  the journals to which we subscribe. Oh, think how much more
  brilliant this dialogue would have been, if we had been
  accustomed to exercise our reflective powers! They say that
  in England the conversation of the very meanest is a corus-
  cation of impromptu epigram!</p>

        <p><span class="dpart">Calynx: </span>My lord, I'm surprised at you. Are you not aware that His
  Majesty, in his despotic acquiescence with the emphatic wish
  of his people, has ordered that the Utopian language shall
  be banished from his court, and that all communications
  shall henceforward be made in the English tongue?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Tarara: </span>Yes, I'm perfectly aware of it, although &#8212; <span class="dir">(suddenly presenting an explosive &quot;cracker&quot;)</span> Stop &#8212; allow me.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Calynx:</span> <span class="dir">(pulls it)</span> Now, what's that for?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Tarara: </span>Why, I've recently been appointed Public Exploder to His
  Majesty, and as I'm constitutionally nervous, I must accus-
  tom myself by degrees to the startling nature of my duties. 
  Thank you. I was about to say that although, as Public
  Exploder, I am next in succession to the throne, I nevertheless do my best to fall in with the royal decree. But when
  I am overmastered by an indignant sense of overwhelming
  wrong, as I am now, I slip into my native tongue without
  knowing it. I am told that in the language of that great
  and pure nation, strong expressions do not exist, consequently when I want to let off steam I have no alternative
  but to say, &quot;Lalabalele molola lililah kallalale poo!&quot;</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Calynx: </span>But what is your grievance?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Tarara: </span>This &#8212; by our Constitution we are governed by a Despot who,
  although in theory absolute &#8212; is, in practice, nothing of the
  kind &#8212; being watched day and night by two Wise Men whose duty
  it is, on his very first lapse from political or social
  propriety, to denounce him to me, the Public Exploder, and
  it then becomes my duty to blow up His Majesty with
  dynamite &#8212; allow me. <span class="dir">(Presenting a cracker which Calynx
  pulls.)</span> Thank you &#8212; and, as some compensation to my wounded
  feelings, I reign in his stead.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Calynx: </span>Yes. After many unhappy experiments in the direction of an
  ideal Republic, it was found that what may be described as a
  Despotism tempered by Dynamite provides, on the whole, the
  most satisfactory description of ruler &#8212; an autocrat who
  dares not abuse his autocratic power.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Tarara: </span>That's the theory &#8212; but in practice, how does it act? Now,
  do you ever happen to see the Palace Peeper?<span class="dir"> (producing a
&quot;Society&quot; paper)</span></p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Calynx:</span> Never even heard of the journal.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Tarara:</span> I'm not surprised, because His Majesty's agents always buy
  up the whole edition; but I have an aunt in the publishing
  department, and she has supplied me with a copy. Well, it
  actually teems with circumstantially convincing details of
  the King's abominable immoralities! If this high-class
  journal may be believed, His Majesty is one of the most
  Heliogabalian profligates that ever disgraced an autocratic
  throne! And do these Wise Men denounce him to me? Not a
  bit of it! They wink at his immoralities! Under the circumstances I really think I am justified in exclaiming
&quot;Lalabelele molola lililah kalabalale poo!&quot;<span class="dir"> (All horrified.)</span> I don't care &#8212; the occasion demands it. <span class="dir">(Exit Tarara)</span></p>
