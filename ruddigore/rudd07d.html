      <div class="btext">
        <p> <span class="dpart">Richard.</span> <span class="dir">(looking after him)</span> Ah, it's a thousand pities he's such a poor 
          opinion of himself, for a finer fellow don't walk! Well, I'll do my best 
          for him. "Plead for him as though it was for your own father" &#8212; that's what 
          my heart's a-remarkin' to me just now. But here she comes! Steady! Steady 
          it is! 
    

          <span class="dir">(Enter Rose &#8212; he is much struck by her.)</span>          By the Port Admiral, but she's a tight little craft! Come, come, she's not 
          for you, Dick, and yet &#8212; she's fit to marry Lord Nelson! By the Flag of Old 
          England, I can't look at her unmoved.        </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Rose. </span>Sir, you are agitated &#8212;</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Richard.</span> Aye, aye, my lass, well said! I am agitated, true enough! &#8212; took 
            flat aback, my girl; but 'tis naught &#8212; 'twill pass. <span class="dir">(aside)</span> This here 
            heart of mine's a-dictatin' to me like anythink. Question is, Have I a 
        right to disregard its promptings?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Rose.</span>Can I do aught to relieve thine anguish, for it seemeth to me that 
        thou art in sore trouble? This apple &#8212; <span class="dir">(offering a damaged apple )</span></p>
        <p> <span class="part">Richard.</span> <span class="dir">(looking at it and returning it)</span> No, my lass, 'tain't that: 
            I'm &#8212; I'm took flat aback &#8212; I never see anything like you in all my born 
            days. Parbuckle me, if you ain't the loveliest gal I've ever set eyes on. 
        There &#8212; I can't say fairer than that, can I?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Rose. </span>No.  <span class="dir">(aside)</span> The question is, Is it meet that an utter stranger should 
        thus express himself? <span class="dir">(refers to book)</span> Yes &#8212; "Always speak the truth."</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Richard.</span> I'd no thoughts of sayin' this here to you on my own account, for, 
          truth to tell, I was chartered by another; but when I see you my heart it 
          up and it says, says it, "This is the very lass for <em>you</em>, Dick" &#8212; "speak up 
            to her, Dick," it says &#8212; ( it calls me Dick acos we was at school 
            together) &#8212; "tell her all, Dick," it says, "never sail under false 
            colours &#8212; it's mean!" <em>That's</em> what my heart tells me to say, and in my 
            rough, common-sailor fashion, I've said it, and I'm a-waiting for your 
            reply. I'm a-tremblin', miss. Lookye here &#8212; <span class="dir">(holding out his hand)</span> That's 
            narvousness!        </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Rose.</span> <span class="dir">(aside)</span>  Now, how should a maiden deal with such an one? <span class="dir">(consults 
            book)</span> "Keep no one in unnecessary suspense." <span class="dir">(aloud)</span> Behold, I will not 
            keep you in unnecessary suspense. <span class="dir">(refers to book)</span> "In accepting an offer 
            of marriage, do so with apparent hesitation." <span class="dir">(aloud)</span> I take you, but with 
            a certain show of reluctance. <span class="dir">(refers to book)</span> "Avoid any appearance of 
            eagerness." <span class="dir">(aloud)</span> Though you will bear in mind that I am far from 
            anxious to do so. <span class="dir">(refers to book.)</span> "A little show of emotion will not be 
        misplaced!" <span class="dir">(aloud)</span> Pardon this tear! <span class="dir">(wipes her eye)</span>          </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Richard.</span>          Rose, you've made me the happiest blue-jacket in England! I wouldn't 
          change places with the Admiral of the Fleet, no matter who he's a-huggin' 
          of at this present moment!  But, axin' your pardon, miss <span class="dir">(wiping his lips 
          with his hand)</span>, might I be permitted to salute the flag I'm a-goin' to 
          sail under?    </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Rose.</span>          <span class="dir">(referring to book)</span> "An engaged young lady should not permit too many 
        familiarities." <span class="dir">(aloud)</span> Once! <span class="dir">(Richard kisses her)</span> </div>
