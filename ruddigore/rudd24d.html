        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  Dame Hannah!  This is – this is not what I expected.            </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Hannah.</span>  Well, sir, and what would you with me?  Oh, you have begun bravely – 
          bravely indeed!  Unappalled by the calm dignity of blameless womanhood, your 
          minion has torn me from my spotless home, and dragged me, blindfold and shrieking, 
          through hedges, over stiles, and across a very difficult country, and left me, helpless 
          and trembling, at your mercy!  Yet not helpless, coward sir, for approach one step –
          nay, but the twentieth part of one poor inch – and this poniard <span class="dir">(produces a very small 
            dagger)</span> shall teach ye what it is to lay unholy hands on old Stephen Trusty's
            daughter!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  Madam, I am extremely sorry for this.  It is not at all what I intended –
          anything more correct – more deeply respectful than my intentions towards you, it 
            would be impossible for any one – however particular – to desire.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Hannah.</span>  Bah, I am not to be tricked by smooth words, hypocrite!  But be warned in 
            time, for there are, without, a hundred gallant hearts whose trusty blades would hack 
            him limb from limb who dared to lay unholy hands on old Stephen Trusty's daughter!            </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  And this is what it is to embark upon a career of unlicensed pleasure!</p>
        <p class="rubric"> Dame Hannah, who has taken a formidable dagger from one of the armed figures, 
              throws her small dagger to Robin.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Hannah. </span>Harkye, miscreant, you have secured me, and I am your poor prisoner; but 
              if you think I cannot take care of myself you are very much mistaken.  Now then, it's 
              one to one, and let the best man win! <span class="dir">(making for him)</span>     </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  <span class="dir">(in an agony of terror)</span>  Don't! don't look at me like that!  I can't bear it!  
              Roderic!  Uncle!  Save me!</p>
        <p class="rubric">Sir Roderic  enters, from his picture.  He comes down the stage.</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Roderic.</span>  What is the matter?  Have you carried her off?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  I have – she is there – look at her – she terrifies me!                </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Roderic.</span>  <span class="dir">(looking at Hannah)</span>  Little Nannikin!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Hannah.</span>  <span class="dir">(amazed)</span>  Roddy-doddy!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Roderic.</span>  My own old love!  Why, how came <em>you</em> here?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Hannah.</span>  This brute – he carried me off!  Bodily!  But I'll show him!  <span class="dir">(about to rush 
                at Robin)</span></p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Roderic.</span>  Stop!  <span class="dir">(to Robin)</span>  What do you mean by carrying off this lady?  Are you 
                aware that once upon a time she was engaged to be married to me?  I'm very angry –
          very angry indeed.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  Now I hope this will be a lesson to you in future not to–          </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Roderic. </span>Hold your tongue, sir.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  Yes, uncle.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Roderic.</span>  Have you given him any encouragement?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Hannah. </span><span class="dir">(to Robin)</span>  Have I given you any encouragement? Frankly now, have I?</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  No.  Frankly, you have not.  Anything more scrupulously correct than your 
        conduct, it would be impossible to desire.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Roderic.</span>  You go away.                  </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  Yes, uncle.<span class="dir"> (Exit Robin)</span></p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Roderic.</span>  This is a strange meeting after so many years!          </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Hannah.</span>  Very.  I thought you were dead.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Roderic.</span>  I am.  I died ten years ago.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Hannah.</span>  And are you pretty comfortable?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Roderic.</span>  Pretty well – that is – yes, pretty well.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Hannah.</span>  You don't deserve to be, for I loved you all the while, dear; and it made me 
                    dreadfully unhappy to hear of all your goings-on, you bad, bad boy! </p>
