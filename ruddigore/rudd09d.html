        <p><span class="dpart">Robin.</span> Well &#8212; what news? Have you spoken to her?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Richard. </span>Aye, my lad, I have &#8212; so to speak &mdash; spoke her. </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Robin.</span> And she refuses?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Richard.</span> Why, no, I can't truly say she do.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin. </span>Then she accepts! My darling! <span class="dir">(Embraces her.)</span></p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Bridesmaids.</span> Hail the Bridegroom &mdash; hail the Bride! etc.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Rose.</span> <span class="dir">(aside, referring to her book)</span>. Now, what should a maiden do when she is embraced by the wrong gentleman?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Richard.</span> Belay, my lad, belay. You don't understand.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Rose.</span> Oh, sir, belay, I beseech you!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Richard.</span> You see, it's like this: she accepts &mdash; but it's <em>me</em>!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span> You! <span class="dir">(Richard embraces Rose.)</span></p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bridesmaids.</span> Hail the Bridegroom &mdash; hail the Bride!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the nuptial knot is tied &mdash; </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Robin.</span> <span class="dir">(interrupting angrily)</span>. Hold your tongues, will you! Now then, what does this mean?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Richard.</span> My poor lad, my heart grieves for thee, but it's like this: the moment I see her, and just as I was a-goin' to mention your name, my heart it up and it says, says it &mdash; 
		&quot;Dick, you've fell in love with her yourself,&quot; it says; &quot;be honest and sailor-like &mdash; don't skulk under false colours &mdash; speak up,&quot; it says, &quot;take her, you dog, and with her my blessin'!&quot;</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Bridesmaids.</span> Hail the Bridegroom &mdash; hail the bride &mdash;</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span> Will you be quiet! Go away! <span class="dir">(Chorus makes faces at him and exeunt.) </span>Vulgar girls!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Richard.</span> What could I do? I'm bound to obey my heart's dictates.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin. </span>Of course &mdash; no doubt. It's quite right &mdash; I don't mind &mdash; that is, not particularly &mdash; only it's &mdash; it <em>is</em> disappointing, you know.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Rose. </span><span class="dir">(to Robin)</span> Oh, but, sir, I knew not that thou didst seek me in wedlock, or in very truth I should not have hearkened unto this man, for behold, he is but a lowly mariner, and very poor withal, whereas thou art a tiller of the land, and thou hast fat oxen, and many sheep and swine, a considerable dairy farm and much corn and oil!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Richard.</span> That's true, my lass, but it's done now, ain't it, Rob?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Rose.</span> Still it may be that I should not be happy in thy love. I am passing young and little able to judge. Moreover, as to thy character I know naught!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span> Nay, Rose, I'll answer for that. Dick has won thy love fairly. Broken- hearted as I am, I'll stand up for Dick through thick and thin!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Richard. </span><span class="dir">(with emotion)</span> Thankye, messmate! that's well said. That's spoken honest. Thankye, Rob! <span class="dir">(Grasps his hand.)</span> </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Rose.</span> Yet methinks I have heard that sailors are but worldly men, and little prone to lead serious and thoughtful lives!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin. </span>And what then? Admit that Dick is <em>not</em> a steady character, and that when he's excited he uses language that would make your hair curl. Grant that &mdash; he does. It's the truth, and I'm not going to deny it. But look at his <em>good</em> qualities. He's as nimble as a pony, and his hornpipe is the talk of the Fleet! </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Richard.</span> Thankye, Rob! That's well spoken. Thankye, Rob! </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Rose. </span>But it may be that he drinketh strong waters which do bemuse a man, and make him even as the wild beasts of the desert! </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Robin.</span> Well, suppose he does, and I don't say he don't, for rum's his bane, and ever has been. He <em>does</em> drink &mdash; I won't deny it. But what of that? Look at his arms &mdash; tattooed to the shoulder!<span class="dir"> (Richard rolls up his sleeves.)</span> No, no &mdash; I won't hear a word against Dick! </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Rose.</span> But they say that mariners are but rarely true to those whom they profess to love!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span> Granted &mdash; granted &mdash; and I don't say that Dick isn't as bad as any of 'em. <span class="dir">(Richard chuckles.)</span> You are, you know you are, you dog! a devil of a fellow &mdash; a regular out-and-out Lothario! But what then? You can't have everything, and a better hand at turning-in a dead-eye don't walk a deck! And what an accomplishment <em>that</em> is in a family man! No, no &mdash; not a word against Dick. I'll stick up for him through thick and thin!</p>
        <span class="dpart">Richard.</span> Thankye, Rob, thankye. You're a true friend. I've acted accordin' to my heart's dictates, and such orders as them no man should disobey.<br>
