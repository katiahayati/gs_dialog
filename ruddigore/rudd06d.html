      <p><span class="dpart">Richard.</span>  Robin!</p>
      <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span> My beloved foster-brother, and very dearest friend, welcome home 
          again after ten long years at sea!  It is such deeds as yours that cause 
        our flag to be loved and dreaded throughout the civilized world!</p>
      <p> <span class="dpart">Richard.</span>  Why, lord love ye, Rob, that's but a trifle to what we <em>have</em> done 
          in the way of sparing life!  I believe I may say, without exaggeration, 
          that the marciful little <em>Tom-Tit</em> has spared more French frigates than any 
          craft afloat!  But 'taint for a
          British seaman to brag, so I'll just stow my jawin' tackle and belay. 
          <span class="dir">(Robin sighs.)</span>  But 'vast heavin', messmate, what's brought <em>you</em> all 
        a-cockbill?</p>
      <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span> Alas, Dick, I love Rose Maybud, and love in vain!        </p>
      <p><span class="dpart">Richard.</span>  <em>You</em> love in vain? Come, that's too good!  Why, you're a fine 
          strapping muscular young fellow &#8212; tall and strong as a 
          to'-gall'n'-m'st &#8212; taut as a forestay &#8212; aye, and a barrowknight to boot, if 
        all had their rights!</p>
      <p><span class="part">Robin.</span>          Hush, Richard &#8212; not a word about my true rank, which none here suspect.  
          Yes, I know well enough that few men are better calculated to win a 
          woman's heart than I.  I'm a fine fellow, Dick, and worthy any woman's 
          love &#8212; happy the girl who gets me, say I.  But I'm timid, Dick; 
          shy &#8212; nervous &#8212; modest &#8212; retiring &#8212; diffident &#8212; and I cannot tell her, Dick, I 
          cannot tell her!  Ah, you've no idea what a poor opinion I have of myself, 
        and how little I deserve it.</p>
      <p><span class="dpart">Richard.</span>  Robin, do you call to mind how, years ago, we swore that, come 
        what might, we would always act upon our hearts' dictates?</p>
      <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>          Aye, Dick, and I've always kept that oath.  In doubt, difficulty, and 
          danger I've always asked my heart what I should do, and it has never 
        failed me.</p>
      <p> <span class="dpart">Richard.</span>          Right! Let your heart be your compass, with a clear conscience for your 
          binnacle light, and you'll sail ten knots on a bowline, clear of shoals, 
          rocks, and quicksands!  Well, now, what does my heart say in this here 
          difficult situation?  Why, it says, "Dick," it says &#8212; (it calls me Dick 
          acos it's known me from a babby) &#8212; "Dick," it says, "<em>you</em> ain't shy &#8212; <em>you</em>          ain't modest &#8212; speak you up for him as is!" Robin, my lad, just you lay me 
          alongside, and when she's becalmed under my lee, I'll spin her a yarn that 
        shall sarve to fish you two together for life!</p>
      <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span> Will you do this thing for me?  Can you, do you think?  Yes <span class="dir">(feeling 
            his pulse)</span>.  There's no false modesty about <em>you</em>.  Your &#8212; what I would call 
            bumptious self-assertiveness (I mean the expression in its complimentary 
            sense) has already made you a bos'n's mate, and it will make an admiral of 
            you in time, if you work it properly, you dear, incompetent old impostor!  
            My dear fellow, I'd give my right arm for one tenth of your modest 
          assurance!</p>
