        <p> <span class="dpart">Margaret. </span>One happy, happy week!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Despard.</span>  Our new life –</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Margaret. </span>Is delightful indeed!	      </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Despard. </span>So calm!	      </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Margaret.</span>  So unimpassioned!  <span class="dir">(wildly)</span>  Master, all this I owe to you!  See, I am no 
        longer wild and untidy.  My hair is combed. My face is washed.  My boots fit!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Despard. </span>Margaret, don't.  Pray restrain yourself.  Remember, you are now a district 
          visitor.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Margaret. </span>A gentle district visitor!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Despard.</span>  You are orderly, methodical, neat; you have your emotions well under 
          control.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Margaret.</span>  I have!  <span class="dir">(wildly)</span>  Master, when I think of all you have done for me, I fall 
          at your feet.  I embrace your ankles.  I hug your knees! <span class="dir">(Doing so.)</span>          </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Despard.</span>  Hush.  This is not well.  This is calculated to provoke remark.  Be 
        composed, I beg!            </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Margaret.</span>  Ah! you are angry with poor little Mad Margaret!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Despard.</span>  No, not angry; but a district visitor should learn to eschew melodrama.  
          Visit the poor, by all means, and give them tea and barley-water, but don't do it as if 
          you were administering a bowl of deadly nightshade.  It upsets them.  Then when you 
          nurse sick people, and find them not as well as could be expected, why go into 
          hysterics?              </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Margaret.</span>  Why not?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Despard. </span>Because it's too jumpy for a sick-room.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Margaret. </span>How strange!  Oh, Master! Master! – how shall I express the all-absorbing 
              gratitude that – <span class="dir">(about to throw herself at his feet)</span></p>

              then, when I am lying awake at night, and the pale moonlight streams through the
              latticed casement, strange fancies crowd upon my poor mad brain, and I sometimes 
              think that if we could hit upon some word for you to use whenever I am about to 
              relapse – some word that teems with hidden meaning – like &quot;Basingstoke&quot; – it might 
              recall me to my saner self.  For, after all, I am only Mad Margaret!  Daft Meg!

        <p><span class="dpart">Despard.</span>  <span class="dir">(aside)</span>  Then make it so.  <span class="dir">(aloud)</span>  My brother – I call you brother still, 
                  despite your horrible profligacy – we have come to urge you to abandon the evil 
                  courses to which you have committed yourself, and at any cost to become a pure and
                  blameless ratepayer.	                  </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  But I've done no wrong yet.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Margaret.</span>  <span class="dir">(wildly)</span>  No wrong!  He has done no wrong!  Did you hear that!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Despard.</span>  Basingstoke!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Margaret.</span>  <span class="dir">(recovering herself)</span>  Basingstoke it is!</p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Despard.</span> My brother – I still call you brother, you observe – you forget that you have 
                  been, in the eye of the law, a Bad Baronet of Ruddigore for ten years – and you are 
                  therefore responsible – in the eye of the law – for all the misdeeds committed by the 
                  unhappy gentleman who occupied your place.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  I see!  Bless my heart, I never thought of that!  Was I very bad?	                  </p>

        <p><span class="dpart">Despard</span>.  Ten years!  Think of all the atrocities you have committed – by attorney as 
                  it were – during that period.  Remember how you trifled with this poor child's 
                  affections – how you raised her hopes on high (don't cry, my love – Basingstoke, you 
                  know), only to trample them in the dust when they were at the very zenith of their 
                  fullness.  Oh fie, sir, fie – she trusted you!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  Did she?  What a scoundrel I must have been!  There, there – don't cry, my 
                  dear, <span class="dir">(to Margaret, who is sobbing on Robin's breast)</span> it's all right now. 
                  Birmingham, you know – Birmingham–          </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Margaret.</span>  <span class="dir">(sobbing)</span>  It's Ba – Ba – Basingstoke!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  Basingstoke!  Of course it is – Basingstoke.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Margaret.</span>  Then make it so!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  There, there – it's all right – he's married you now – that is, I've married 
                  you <span class="dir">(turning to Despard)</span> – I say, which of us has married her?	                  </p>
        <p><span class="dpart">Despard. </span>Oh, I've married her.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Robin.</span>  <span class="dir">(aside)</span>  Oh, I'm glad of that.  <span class="dir">(To Margaret)</span>  Yes, he's married you 
                  now, <span class="dir">(passing her over to Despard)</span> and anything more disreputable than my 
                  conduct seems to have been I've never even heard of.  But my mind is made up – I 
                  <em>will</em> defy my ancestors. I <em>will</em> refuse to obey their behests, thus, by courting death,
                  atone in some degree for the infamy of my career!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Margaret.</span>  I knew it – I knew it – God bless you – <span class="dir">(hysterically)</span></p>
