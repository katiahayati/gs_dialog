      <div class="btext">
        <p><span class="dpart">Duke. </span>At last we have arrived at our destination. This is the Ducal Palace, and it is here that the Grand Inquisitor resides. As a Castilian hidalgo of ninety-five quarterings, I regret that I am unable to pay my state visit on a horse. As a Castilian hidalgo of that description, I should have preferred to ride through the streets of Venice; but owing, I presume, to an unusually wet season, the streets are in such a condition that equestrian exercise is impracticable. No matter. Where is our suite?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Luiz.</span> <span class="dir">(coming forward)</span> Your Grace, I am here.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duchess.</span> Why do you not do yourself the honour to kneel when you address His Grace?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>My love, it is so small a matter! <span class="dir">(To Luiz.)</span> Still, you may as well do it. <span class="dir">(Luiz kneels.)</span></p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Casilda.</span> The young man seems to entertain but an imperfect appreciation of the respect due from a menial to a Castilian hidalgo.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>My child, you are hard upon our suite.</p>
        <p> <span class="part">Casilda. </span>Papa, I've no patience with the presumption of persons in his plebeian position. If he does not appreciate that position, let him be whipped until he does.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>Let us hope the omission was not intended as a slight. I should be much hurt if I thought it was. So would he. <span class="dir">(To Luiz.)</span> Where are the halberdiers who were to have had the honour of meeting us here, that our visit to the Grand Inquisitor might be made in becoming state?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Luiz. </span>Your Grace, the halberdiers are mercenary people who stipulated for a trifle on account.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>How tiresome! Well, let us hope the Grand Inquisitor is a blind gentleman. And the band who were to have had the honour of escorting us? I see no band!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Luiz. </span>Your Grace, the band are sordid persons who required to be paid in advance.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duchess. </span>That's so like a band!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span><span class="dir">(annoyed)</span> Insuperable difficulties meet me at every turn!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duchess. </span>But surely they know His Grace?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Luiz. </span>Exactly &#8212; they know His Grace.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>Well, let us hope that the Grand Inquisitor is a deaf gentleman. A cornet-a-piston would be something. You do not happen to possess the accomplishment of tootling like a cornet-a-piston?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Luiz. </span>Alas, no, Your Grace! But I can imitate a farmyard.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke.</span><span class="dir"> (doubtfully)</span>. I don't see how that would help us. I don't see how we could bring it in.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Casilda. </span>It would not help us in the least. We are not a parcel of graziers come to market, dolt! <span class="dir">(Luiz rises.)</span></p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>My love, our suite's feelings! <span class="dir">(To Luiz.)</span> Be so good as to ring the bell and inform the Grand Inquisitor that his Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Count Matadoro, Baron Picadoro &#8212;</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duchess. </span>And suite &#8212;</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>And suite &#8212; have arrived at Venice, and seek &#8212;</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Casilda.</span> Desire &#8212;</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duchess. </span>Demand!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>And demand an audience.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Luiz. </span>Your Grace has but to command.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span><span class="dir">(much moved)</span>. I felt sure of it &#8212; I felt sure of it! <span class="dir">(Exit Luiz into Ducal Palace.)</span> And now, my love &#8212; <span class="dir">(aside to Duchess)</span> Shall we tell her? I think so &#8212; <span class="dir">(aloud to Casilda)</span> And now, my love, prepare for a magnificent surprise. It is my agreeable duty to reveal to you a secret which should make you the happiest young lady in Venice!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Casilda. </span>A secret?<br>
          <span class="dpart">Duchess.</span> A secret which, for State reasons, it has been necessary to preserve for twenty years.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>When you were a prattling babe of six months old you were married by proxy to no less a personage than the infant son and heir of His Majesty the immeasurably wealthy King of Barataria!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Casilda. </span>Married to the infant son of the King of Barataria? Was I consulted? <span class="dir">(Duke shakes his head.)</span> Then it was a most unpardonable liberty!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>Consider his extreme youth and forgive him. Shortly after the ceremony that misguided monarch abandoned the creed of his forefathers, and became a Wesleyan Methodist of the most bigoted and persecuting type. The Grand Inquisitor, determined that the innovation should not be perpetuated in Barataria, caused your smiling and unconscious husband to be stolen and conveyed to Venice. A fortnight since the Methodist Monarch and all his Wesleyan Court were killed in an insurrection, and we are here to ascertain the whereabouts of your husband, and to hail you, our daughter, as Her Majesty, the reigning Queen of Barataria!<span class="dir"> (Kneels.) </span></p>
        <p class="rubric">During this speech Luiz re-enters.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duchess. </span>Your Majesty! <span class="dir">(Kneels.) (Drum roll.)</span></p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>It is at such moments as these that one feels how necessary it is to travel with a full band.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Casilda. </span>I, the Queen of Barataria! But I've nothing to wear! We are practically penniless!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>That point has not escaped me. Although I am unhappily in straitened circumstances at present, my social influence is something enormous; and a Company, to be called the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Limited, is in course of formation to work me. An influential directorate has been secured, and I shall myself join the Board after allotment.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Casilda.</span> Am I to understand that the Queen of Barataria may be called upon at any time to witness her honoured sire in process of liquidation?</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duchess. </span>The speculation is not exempt from that drawback. If your father should stop, it will, of course, be necessary to wind him up.</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Casilda. </span>But it's so undignified &#8212; it's so degrading! A Grandee of Spain turned into a public company! Such a thing was never heard of!</p>
        <p> <span class="dpart">Duke. </span>My child, the Duke of Plaza-Toro does not follow fashions--he leads them. He always leads everybody. When he was in the army he led his regiment. He occasionally led them into action. He invariably led them out of it.<br>
